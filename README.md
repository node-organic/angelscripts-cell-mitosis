# angelscripts-cell-mitosis

Angel scripts for deploying organic cells on `vps` infrastructure.

## How to install

The minimal version of nodejs is: `Nodejs version 4+`

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install angelscripts-cell-mitosis --save-dev
```

## VPS requirements

`angelscripts-cell-mitosis` requires `Ubuntu` version 14.04+ or Debian version 7+

## Testing

Doesn't have a test section. Why ?

Simulation of vps is really a tough task and for us is wasting of time.

If you project requires 100% test coverage you're more than welcome to PR in this repo.
